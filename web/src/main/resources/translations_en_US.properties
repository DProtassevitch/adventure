home.title=Why I Love Traveling
home.first.border=Ever since I was a kid, just going around the ‘next bend’ on my bicycle, I have always loved the adventure of travel – the unknown, something different, something new. And I feel the same way today… even though now the ‘next bend’ may be on another continent. I have been extremely lucky to continuously feed my passion for travel. Many out there share my passion while others do not.  But, why do I love it so much?
home.second.border=I love the excitement of it all–feeling like an explorer–discovering a new land, a new language, new money and all the little challenges that go along with it. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don’t live for the future or the past… just in the moment. Being impulsive and saying ‘yes’ to nearly everything is part of the fun.
home.thirth.border=I love the rush. Habitual runners get off on the kick-in of endorphins that give them that extra boost they need to keep going. I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land (for me… not for all mankind) that I hadn’t planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling. Traveling can be a challenge, but to me, a fun challenge that I enjoy conquering time and time again.  Plus it sure beats having to vacuum, pay bills, or shop for toilet paper.
